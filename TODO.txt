Refactor: 
    Break pipewrence up into separable class files. 
    Rename the executable to sauron and any references to pipewrench or PipeWrench are now sauron. 
        The title bar can read "Sauron's Eye"

Feature updates:

    Look at the SauronEye directory for starters. It includes the AI router and the keyboard 
        interposer.
    The router needs to be cleaned up since all the capture interface is on sauron in the C++ 
        side, while sauron will need to implement the commands received from the keyboard 
        related to capture/send. The main reason for keeping this code python is debatable
        since all the AI interfaces are wrappers around HTTP. One idea worth considering is
        if utilities like LangChain are useful and why if the functionality can be done in C++
        easily it should be. Like why not make a vector store locally in C++ ? that would be
        impressive.
    Some commands from the keyboard are for the use of the AI router's chat 
        interface, in particular to scroll the text area. Some are for the capture UI.
        This will also need to be part of the AI router clean up.
